                    <li>Member agrees that all activities that occur under your account (including without limitation, posting
                        any company or product information, clicking to accept any Additional Agreements or rules, subscribing
                        to or making any payment for any services, sending emails using the email account or sending SMS)

                        of your business entity to use your account (collectively, "multiple use"), may cause irreparable

                        also agrees that in case of the multiple use of your account or Member’s failure to maintain the
                        security of your account, Supplierscave.com shall not be liable for any loss or damages arising from
                        such a breach and shall have the right to suspend or terminate Member’s account without liability
                        to Member.</li>
