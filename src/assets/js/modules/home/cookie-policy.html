                <p class="cookie-font">
                    A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page server. Cookies contain information that can
                    later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Some of the cookies will only
                    be used if you use certain features or select certain preferences, and some cookies will always be used.
                    You can find out more about each cookie by viewing our current cookie list below. We update this list
                    quarterly, so there may be additional cookies that are not yet listed. Web beacons, tags and scripts
                    may be used in the Websites or in emails to help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage
                    and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may receive
                    reports based on the use of these technologies by our service/analytics providers on an individual and
                    aggregated basis.
